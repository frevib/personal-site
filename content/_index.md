Hi, my name is Hielke and I am a **software engineer** with 10+ work experience and 20+ years technology experience. 

Next to software engineer I am a **security specialist**. I've worked 5 years as a pentester for webapps and infra and continued to do security for the teams where I was software developer or tech lead.

As language of choice I favour strongly-typed languages that have good functional programming support. **Kotlin** is one of those languages.

My favorite jobs are designing and building systems that include **streams, async programming and concurrency**. I value high quality code and think that this is a [faster][clean_code_link] and [more efficient][clean_architecture_link] way to build products.

Have a look at my [CV](/portfolio)

Besides Kotlin and Java I've build applications or worked with:

JavaScript, React, React-Native, Angular, Webcomponents, C, Python, Django, PHP, Clojure, Common Lisp, Elm, Haskell, Scala, k8s, Azure, GCP, AWS, OVH cloud, Digital Ocean, Groovy, HTML, CSS, and likely and a lot more (e.g. Perl). I can also read some x86/x64 assembly and did a few reverse engineering jobs.

In my latests positions I was a **tech lead** for a startup in a big corporate. There we built a machine learning product that included software engineering, data engineering and data science. Have a look at my [CV](/portfolio)



<!-- ## Kotlin
If you run a Java project, consider switching to Kotlin. It is an objective improvement. We were (one of?) the first teams that started to using Kotlin at ING. We [pushed](ref blog julien) long for it, but it made many developers very happy. Kotlin seemlesly integrates with Java. It lets the developer write less code, more concise, and with less bugs. Developers like proper tools, that makes them happy. Java is dated and sometimes feels like a stretch to work with. Kotlin addressed many of Java's pain points and replaced them with very good replacements. -->
